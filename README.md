# plotly-challenge

In this exercise we use javascript to create dynamic charts using plotly.
Based on the dataset given, we use D3 and plotly to dynamically change charts based on a dropdown selection.
We use two different chart types to show how versatile plotly is, as well as D3 functionalities.

In this assignment, we build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
